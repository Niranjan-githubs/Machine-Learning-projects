# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various diagnostic measurements. The model is built using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with a linear kernel. It's trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and aims to assist in early diabetes detection.

## Dataset

The model is trained using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains the following features:

- **Pregnancies:** Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness:** Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin:** 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI:** Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age:** Age (years)

The target variable is **Outcome**, which indicates whether the person has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Model Development

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded and preprocessed, including handling missing values and standardizing the features using `StandardScaler` to ensure they have zero mean and unit variance.

2. **Model Training:** The data is split into training and testing sets. An SVM model with a linear kernel is initialized and trained on the training data using the `SVC` class from scikit-learn.

3. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the testing data using the `accuracy_score` metric to measure its performance in predicting diabetes.

## Usage

To use the model for prediction:

1. **Input Data:** Provide the input data as a tuple or list containing the values for the eight features in the same order as mentioned above.

2. **Data Transformation:** The input data is transformed using the same `StandardScaler` object used during training.

3. **Prediction:** The transformed data is fed to the trained SVM model to obtain the prediction (0 or 1).

4. **Output:** The prediction is interpreted as "The person is not diabetic" if the prediction is 0, and "The person is diabetic" if the prediction is 1.
