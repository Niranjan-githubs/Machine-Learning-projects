# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether an object detected by a sonar is a rock or a mine. It's based on a dataset of sonar signals, and uses a Logistic Regression model for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "sonar data.csv" file. It contains 60 numerical features representing sonar signal characteristics, and a target variable indicating whether the object is a rock (R) or a mine (M).

## Model

A Logistic Regression model is trained on the dataset to classify the objects. The model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance.

## Usage

1.  **Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
3.  **Model Training:** A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** The model's accuracy is evaluated on the testing data.
5.  **Prediction:** The model is used to predict the class of a new sonar signal.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of around 83% on the testing data.
